    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Having spent the last twenty years as a professional musician – both performing and teaching – I have discovered
        a passion for computer programming and software development in 2024. I have spent this year learning the
        essentials of computer science and object-oriented programming with Java, supplemented with additional courses
        in web development (HTML, CSS, JS). On the horizon, I plan to stick with Java for upcoming courses in data
        structures & algorithms, adding an introduction to Python this fall, and the goal of learning Go in 2025 for an
        introduction to lower level languages.</p>
